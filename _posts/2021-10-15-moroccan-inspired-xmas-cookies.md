This is a recipe I put together myself, to give Xmas a Moroccan touch. These cookies are spicy, and very tasty to be enjoyed with tea or coffee.

## Ingredients

- 250g room temperature butter
- 150ml of neutral vegetable oil
- 100g sugar
- Orange blossom water
- 100g toasted sesame
- 100g chopped almonds
- 150g dried fruits (here I used cranberries and chopped figs)
- one and a hald tsp baking powder
- all purpose white flour
- powdered sugar (for a final touch)
- cookie mold (optional)

## Directions

1. In a medium bowl, cream together butter, white sugar, oil, salt, orange blossom water and vanilla. Add in the spices, nuts and dried fruit. Combine flour, baking powder; stir into a soft dough consistency.
2. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C. Grease cookie sheets. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls, then mold the cookies using any mold you like. If you don't have a cookie mold, place the cookie balls few centimeters apart on cookie sheets. Flatten each cookie with a large fork dipped in sugar.
3. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in preheated oven, until golden brown. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Sprinkle some acing sugar on the top (optional).
